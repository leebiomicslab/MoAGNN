# MoAGNN: Hierarchical Multiâ€‘omics Graph Neural Network with SAGPooling
We propose MoAGNN, a gene-centric hierarchical graph neural network that integrates transcriptome, miRNA, methylation, and CNV data within a biologically informed framework. Incorporating regulatory directions and attention-based hierarchical pooling, MoAGNN models gene-level dynamics to provide interpretable multi-omics integration.
